An interactive particle simulation built with Rust and Macroquad. Click and drag to create colorful particle fountains with realistic physics.

## Features

- Dynamic particle spawning with mouse interaction
- Physics simulation with gravity and air resistance
- Particles fade based on their lifetime
- Real-time particle count display

## How to Run

1. Install Rust and Cargo
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `cargo run` in the project directory
4. Click and drag on the window to create particle fountains

## Implementation Details
